  2. Secure login and logout.
  3. Authenticated access to user-specific profile information.
  4. Editable user profile with persistent data storage in the database.

### Phase 2: Transactions
- Define and document API endpoints to support transaction management, including the ability for users to view, add, edit, and delete transaction details.
